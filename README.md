# vulnsearch
A deep look at some recon methods and web-app vulnerabilities of my interest 
where I'll merge all my notes gathered from books, videos, articles and own experience.

### My approach
For each vulnerability I will first write an intro with a general overview, explanation of what the vulnerability is all about and then dig in the developer perspective, learning how a developer would implement the application feature related
to the vulnerability. 

My explanations will be based on:

* official documentations
* [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)
* [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com)

each folder about a vulnerability will be structured like this:
```
 vulnerability/
      |-- intro       #general overview, book chapters/pages, list of required/recommended knowledge
      |-- implementation
      |-- attack-type1
      |-- attack-type2
      |-- attack-type-n
      |-- mitigation
```

and folders about a recon methodology will only contain a README.md file (and if needed some code)
